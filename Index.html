                    Why Miley is the best?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Miley is a globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while also being an incredible dancer, actress and performer.
                    Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the sets, the choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas internationally.  
                    Miley has been at the peak of the music world for over 15 years and has always successfully reinvented herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop, rock and country.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, Miley founded The Happy Hippie Foundation in 2015 to raise awareness about issues facing the LGBTQ+ community and address homelessness head-on.
                    She has also used her platform to raise awareness and drive change within the Black Lives Matter movement, demonstrating that she is not only a talented artist but also an inspiring social activist.

                        Hi! My name is Ebba and I've been living in Gothenburg for several years. I'm very fond of Miley Cyrus. I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
