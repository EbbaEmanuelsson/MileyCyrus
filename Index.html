                    Why Miley is the best?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It’s unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Miley is a globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while also being an incredible dancer, actress and performer.
                    Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the sets, the choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas internationally.  
                    Miley has been at the peak of the music world for over 15 years and has always successfully reinvented herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop, rock and country.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, Miley founded The Happy Hippie Foundation in 2015 to raise awareness about issues facing the LGBTQ+ community and address homelessness head-on.
                    She has also used her platform to raise awareness and drive change within the Black Lives Matter movement, demonstrating that she is not only a talented artist but also an inspiring social activist.

                <p> got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
                    I have a heart that will never be tamed
                    I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
                    Now I can't wait to see you again…

                    It was released by Hollywood Records as the lead single from the second studio album Breakout, with no ties to Cyrus' 
                   character Hannah Montana from the Disney Channel series. Also registered as "Seven Things I Hate About You", 
                   Cyrus developed the song during the Best of Both Worlds Tour while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger.

                    I probably shouldn't say this
                    But at times I get so scared
                    When I think about the previous
                    Relationship we shared
                    It was awesome, but we lost it
                    It's not possible for me not to care…

                <h4>Rose colored lenses</h4>
                <p>
                    Endless Summer Vacation is the eighth studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus, 
                    released on March 10, 2023, through Columbia Records. It is her first body of original 
                    work since leaving RCA Records after her seventh studio album Plastic Hearts (2020) and signing 
                    with Columbia in early 2021. And rose colored lenses is my favorite song from that album.

                    Sunrise got us up early
                    So we put on our shade
                    Somehow the bedsheets are dirty
                    Like sticky sweet lemonade
                    Never wanna leave this room
                    Daydream, déjà vu
                    If I had control over you…
                </p>
